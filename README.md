### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Brendon and Iâ€™ll be honest, I didnâ€™t plan on a Career in Web Development. at first, I coded because I enjoyed it, then I realized that if I want to make something serious out of it, I need to learn the industry and practices. So here I am. I really enjoy solving problems and I am very proficient with technology. Between building my truck, motorcycle and tearing apart any electronics I can get my hands on, The next step in my learning adventure is building programs and software.
 	
  I served 5 years in the Marines which taught me how to approach problems from different perspectives and I have always had a learning mindset. I really want to work somewhere that my ambition can thrive and my past sales experience can be utilized. I seek out perfection like anyone else, sometimes that means working together and sometimes that means working alone. I try to balance both.
